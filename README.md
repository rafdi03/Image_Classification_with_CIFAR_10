## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset includes 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 categories, such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, and more.

Key steps in this project:
- Preprocessing the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Implementing data augmentation techniques.
- Building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Evaluating model performance and visualizing metrics.

## Features
- Preprocessing and augmentation of CIFAR-10 dataset images.
- Use of a deep learning architecture for classification.
- Evaluation using metrics like accuracy and loss on test data.
- Visualization of predictions and misclassifications.

## Dataset
The project uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, a popular benchmark for image classification tasks. The dataset is downloaded programmatically from Kaggle or other sources.
